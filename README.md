As a company exporting spare parts of EOT cranes from India, we recognize the importance of efficient data analysis to streamline our operations and make 
informed business decisions. That is why we are leveraging various tools and technologies such as Python for data analysis, SQL for database management,
Power BI, Tableau, and QuickSight for data visualization. With the help of Python, we can perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on our datasets to extract 
meaningful insights and patterns. SQL allows us to manage our data efficiently by organizing it into tables, making it easier to query and analyze. Power BI, 
Tableau, and QuickSight are powerful data visualization tools that enable us to create interactive dashboards and reports, providing a comprehensive view of 
our data. By combining these tools, we can make data-driven decisions that optimize our supply chain and improve our overall business performance.


1. Python for Data Analysis -

We used Python to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on our datasets, which helped us to identify patterns and trends in our data. Through EDA, we gained insights into our customers' buying behavior, such as which spare parts are most frequently purchased and which parts are most commonly replaced. We also used Python to perform predictive analytics, such as forecasting future demand for certain spare parts based on historical data.

2. SQL for Database Management -

We used SQL to manage our data efficiently by organizing it into tables and optimizing queries for faster data retrieval. With SQL, we were able to create a well-structured database that allowed us to quickly retrieve and analyze specific data points.

3. Power BI
